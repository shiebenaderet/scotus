                    <h3>What Happened?</h3>
                    <p>In the 1950s, many states had laws requiring racial segregation in public schools. These laws said that Black children and white children could not attend the same schools. This system was called "separate but equal" - the idea that as long as both races had schools, it was constitutional to keep them separate.</p>

                    <p>Linda Brown was a Black third-grader who lived in Topeka, Kansas. Every day, Linda had to walk six blocks through a dangerous railroad switchyard, then take a bus to Monroe Elementary School, the school designated for Black children. This journey was long and potentially dangerous.</p>

                    <p>However, there was another elementary school, Sumner School, just seven blocks from Linda's home. Linda could not attend Sumner School because it was designated for white children only.</p>

                    <p>In 1951, Linda's father, Oliver Brown, tried to enroll Linda at Sumner School. The school refused to admit her based solely on her race. Oliver Brown was frustrated and contacted the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People).</p>

                    <p>The NAACP decided to challenge the "separate but equal" doctrine. They combined Linda's case with similar cases from South Carolina, Virginia, Delaware, and Washington D.C. Twelve other families joined the lawsuit.</p>

                    <h3>The Big Question</h3>
                    <p>Does racial segregation in public schools violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment? Even if the separate schools are equal in quality?</p>

                    <h3>What You Need to Know</h3>
                    <p>The Fourteenth Amendment says:</p>
                    <blockquote class="constitutional-text">
                        "No State shall...deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>This means all people must be treated equally under the law.</p>
                    <p>The previous legal doctrine of "separate but equal" came from an 1896 case called Plessy v. Ferguson, which said segregation was constitutional as long as the facilities were equal.</p>

                    <h3>Important Facts</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Linda Brown was in third grade when the case began</li>
                        <li>She had to travel much farther to school than necessary because of segregation</li>
                        <li>The case combined five different lawsuits from different states</li>
                        <li>Even when facilities appeared equal, segregation caused psychological harm to Black children</li>
                        <li>The NAACP used social science research to show the harmful effects of segregation</li>
                        <li>This case overturned nearly 60 years of "separate but equal" precedent</li>

                    <h3>What Happened?</h3>
                    <p>A long time ago, some states had bad rules about schools. The rules said Black kids and white kids could not go to school together.</p>

                    <p>The law said schools could be "separate but equal." This meant:
- Black kids go to one school
- White kids go to a different school
- If both schools look the same, then it is okay</p>

                    <p>Linda Brown was a Black girl in third grade. She lived in Kansas. Every day, Linda had to walk very far to get to school. She walked through a scary place with trains. Then she got on a bus.</p>

                    <p>But there was another school very close to Linda's house. It was only a short walk away. Linda could not go there. Why? Because it was only for white kids.</p>

                    <p>Linda's dad tried to sign her up for the close school. The school said, "No. Linda is Black."</p>

                    <p>Linda's dad was mad. He said, "This is not fair!" Twelve other families agreed. They all went to court.</p>

                            <p>Today, schools in wealthier neighborhoods often have more resources, better facilities, and more experienced teachers than schools in poorer areas. Many argue this creates a new form of unequal education.</p>

                            <p>Many schools remain largely separated by race - not because of laws, but because neighborhoods are segregated. This is called "de facto" (in practice) segregation versus "de jure" (by law) segregation.</p>
