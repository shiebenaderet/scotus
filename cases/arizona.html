                    <h3>What Happened?</h3>
                    <p>In 2010, Arizona passed a law called S.B. 1070 to address problems related to illegal immigration. The state was facing high costs from undocumented immigrants in education, healthcare, and law enforcement, and believed the federal government wasn't doing enough to enforce immigration laws.</p>

                    <p>The Arizona law had several provisions that made it a state crime to be an undocumented immigrant, required police to check the immigration status of anyone they stopped, and allowed employers to face penalties for hiring undocumented workers.</p>

                    <p>The federal government sued Arizona, arguing that the state law conflicted with federal immigration law. The government's position was that immigration is a federal responsibility, not a state one.</p>

                    <h3>The Big Question</h3>
                    <p>Can states pass their own immigration laws? Or is immigration exclusively the federal government's responsibility?</p>

                    <h3>What You Need to Know</h3>
                    <p>The Supremacy Clause (Article VI, Clause 2) says:</p>
                    <blockquote class="constitutional-text">
                        "This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof...shall be the supreme Law of the Land...any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding."
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>This means when federal law and state law conflict, federal law wins.</p>
                    <p>The Constitution also gives the federal government power over naturalization and foreign relations. Immigration involves relationships with other countries.</p>

                    <h3>Important Facts</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Arizona borders Mexico and has many undocumented immigrants</li>
                        <li>S.B. 1070 was nicknamed the "show me your papers" law</li>
                        <li>The federal government sued before the law took effect</li>
                        <li>Many people worried about racial profiling of Latino Americans</li>
                        <li>The law was very controversial and sparked nationwide protests</li>
                        <li>Immigration has traditionally been controlled by the federal government</li>
                        <li>Arizona argued the federal government wasn't doing enough</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>What Happened?</h3>
                    <p>In 2010, the state of Arizona made a new law about immigration. Arizona has a big problem with people coming into the state from Mexico without permission. The state said the federal government was not doing enough to stop this.</p>

                    <p>The new law said:
- Being in Arizona without permission from the government is a crime
- Police must check if people have permission to be in America
- Businesses can get in trouble for hiring people without permission</p>

                    <p>The federal government did not like this law. They took Arizona to court. The federal government said, "Immigration is our job, not the state's job!"</p>

                    <p>The argument about who's in charge - states or the federal government - is still happening today. Here are some examples:</p>

                            <p>Some cities say they won't help the federal government find undocumented people. The federal government says cities have to help.</p>
                            <p class="event-note">What do you think: Can cities choose not to follow federal rules?</p>

                            <p>Some states have made marijuana legal, but the federal government still says it's illegal. This is confusing because both can't be right!</p>

                            <p>States near the border say they should be able to make their own rules about who comes in. But immigration affects the whole country.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Why might the people who wrote the Constitution have wanted the big government to be in charge of immigration?</li>
                        <li>What might happen if every state had totally different immigration rules?</li>
                        <li>How can states deal with problems without fighting with the federal government?</li>
