                    <h3>What Happened?</h3>
                    <p>In 2010, Arizona passed a law called S.B. 1070 to address problems related to illegal immigration. The state was facing high costs from undocumented immigrants in education, healthcare, and law enforcement, and believed the federal government wasn't doing enough to enforce immigration laws.</p>

                    <p>The Arizona law had several provisions that made it a state crime to be an undocumented immigrant, required police to check the immigration status of anyone they stopped, and allowed employers to face penalties for hiring undocumented workers.</p>

                    <p>The federal government sued Arizona, arguing that the state law conflicted with federal immigration law. The government's position was that immigration is a federal responsibility, not a state one.</p>

                    <h3>The Big Question</h3>
                    <p>Can states pass their own immigration laws? Or is immigration exclusively the federal government's responsibility?</p>

                    <h3>What You Need to Know</h3>
                    <p>The Constitution gives Congress the power to regulate immigration and naturalization. The Supremacy Clause says federal law is supreme over state law. But states have always helped enforce federal laws within their borders. The question is how far this state authority extends.</p>

                    <h3>Important Facts</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Arizona passed S.B. 1070 to address illegal immigration</li>
                        <li>The law made it a state crime to be undocumented</li>
                        <li>The law required police to check immigration status</li>
                        <li>The federal government sued to block the law</li>
                        <li>The issue is about federal vs. state power</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>What Happened?</h3>
                    <p>In 2010, the state of Arizona made a new law about immigration. Arizona has a big problem with people coming into the state from Mexico without permission. The state said the federal government was not doing enough to stop this.</p>

                    <p>The new law said:
- Being in Arizona without permission from the government is a crime
- Police must check if people have permission to be in America
- Businesses can get in trouble for hiring people without permission</p>

                    <p>The federal government did not like this law. They took Arizona to court. The federal government said, "Immigration is our job, not the state's job!"</p>

                    <h3>The Big Question</h3>
                    <p>Can states make their own rules about people coming to America?</p>
