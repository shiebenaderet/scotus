                    <h3>What Happened?</h3>
                    <p>In March 1980, a teacher at Piscataway High School in New Jersey discovered two girls smoking cigarettes in a school restroom. Smoking was allowed in designated areas of the school, but not in the restrooms.</p>

                    <p>The teacher brought both students to the principal's office to meet with Assistant Vice Principal Theodore Choplick. One of the girls immediately admitted to smoking. The other girl, a 14-year-old freshman referred to in court records as T.L.O. (to protect her privacy as a minor), denied smoking in the restroom and claimed she did not smoke at all.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Choplick did not believe T.L.O.'s denial. He demanded to see her purse. When T.L.O. handed over her purse, Choplick opened it and immediately saw a pack of cigarettes. He also noticed cigarette rolling papers, which are commonly associated with marijuana use.</p>

                    <p>Suspecting that T.L.O. might have drugs, Choplick conducted a more thorough search of her purse and found:
- A small amount of marijuana
- A pipe used for smoking marijuana
- Empty plastic bags typically used for drug sales
- A substantial amount of money
- An index card with names of students who owed T.L.O. money
- Two letters that implicated T.L.O. in marijuana dealing</p>

                    <p>Choplick called T.L.O.'s mother and contacted the police. At the police station, T.L.O. confessed to selling marijuana at school. The state of New Jersey brought delinquency charges against her in juvenile court.</p>

                    <p>T.L.O.'s lawyer argued that the evidence found in her purse should not be allowed in court because the search violated her Fourth Amendment rights. The lawyer claimed that Choplick had no right to search her purse without a warrant.</p>

                    <h3>The Big Question</h3>
                    <p>Can school officials search students' personal belongings without a warrant? What level of suspicion do school officials need before conducting a search?</p>

                    <h3>What You Need to Know</h3>
                    <p>The Fourth Amendment protects against "unreasonable searches and seizures." Usually, this means police need a warrant from a judge before searching someone's belongings. However, schools have special responsibilities for student safety and supervision.</p>

                    <h3>Important Facts</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>T.L.O. was caught violating a school rule (smoking in restroom)</li>
                        <li>She denied smoking and claimed she never smoked</li>
                        <li>The initial search immediately revealed cigarettes, contradicting her denial</li>
                        <li>The discovery of rolling papers gave reasonable suspicion of drug possession</li>
                        <li>The more thorough search revealed evidence of drug dealing</li>
                        <li>Students have some Fourth Amendment rights, but schools have special authority</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>What Happened?</h3>
                    <p>In 1980, a teacher at a high school saw two girls in the bathroom. They were smoking cigarettes.</p>

                    <p>Students could smoke in some places at school. But not in the bathrooms. Smoking in the bathroom was against the rules.</p>

                    <p>The teacher took both girls to the office. They met with Mr. Choplick, who was like the principal.</p>

                    <p>One girl said, "Yes, I was smoking." The other girl - we call her T.L.O. - said, "No, I was not smoking. I do not smoke at all."</p>

                    <p>Mr. Choplick did not believe T.L.O. He said, "Let me see your purse." He opened it. Right away, he saw cigarettes.</p>

                    <p>Then he saw something else. Special papers that people use to roll cigarettes. These papers are often used with drugs.</p>

                    <p>Now Mr. Choplick thought T.L.O. might have drugs. He looked through her purse more carefully.</p>

                    <p>He found:
- Marijuana (an illegal drug)
- A pipe (used to smoke drugs)
- Empty bags (used to hold drugs)
- Lots of one-dollar bills
- A list of kids who owed T.L.O. money
- Letters that showed T.L.O. was selling drugs</p>

                    <p>Mr. Choplick called T.L.O.'s mom. He also called the police.</p>

                    <p>At the police station, T.L.O. said she had been selling drugs at school. The police wanted to put her in trouble.</p>

                    <p>But T.L.O.'s lawyer said, "You cannot use what you found in her purse. Mr. Choplick was not allowed to look in there."</p>

                    <h3>The Big Question</h3>
                    <p>Can school workers look through a student's things without asking a judge first?</p>

                    <h3>Important Facts</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A teacher saw T.L.O. breaking a rule</li>
                        <li>T.L.O. said she was not smoking</li>
                        <li>T.L.O. said she did not smoke at all</li>
                        <li>Mr. Choplick looked in her purse to see if she was lying</li>
                        <li>He found cigarettes first</li>
                        <li>Then he found drug things and kept looking</li>
                        <li>Kids are young and schools watch over them</li>
