                    <h3>What Happened?</h3>
                    <p>In 1965, during the Vietnam War, three public school students in Des Moines, Iowa decided to protest the war. Mary Beth Tinker (13), her brother John Tinker (15), and Christopher Eckhardt (16) planned to wear black armbands to school to symbolize their opposition to the war.</p>

                    <p>When school principals learned of the plan, they created a policy banning armbands. The policy stated that any student wearing an armband would be asked to remove it, and refusal would result in suspension.</p>

                    <p>On December 16, 1965, Mary Beth Tinker and Christopher Eckhardt wore their armbands to school and were suspended. The next day, John Tinker did the same and was also suspended. The students did not return to school until after the holiday protest period had ended.</p>

                    <p>The Tinker family sued the school district, arguing that the students' First Amendment rights to free speech had been violated. The case eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>

                    <h3>The Big Question</h3>
                    <p>Can schools prohibit students from wearing armbands to express their political views? Do students have First Amendment rights to free speech in school?</p>

                    <h3>What You Need to Know</h3>
                    <p>The First Amendment says:</p>
                    <blockquote class="constitutional-text">
                        "Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech..."
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>This means the government cannot stop people from expressing their ideas. Schools are part of the government, so this applies to them too.</p>
                    <p>The question is whether students keep their constitutional rights when they enter school, or whether schools can limit speech to maintain order.</p>

                    <h3>Important Facts</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The students wore armbands silently and did not disrupt classes</li>
                        <li>The school allowed other political symbols (like Iron Crosses during WWII)</li>
                        <li>The school only banned armbands related to the Vietnam War</li>
                        <li>No actual disruption occurred - the school acted based on fear of potential disruption</li>
                        <li>The students were peaceful and did not interfere with other students' learning</li>
                        <li>This was during a very controversial war that divided American society</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>What Happened?</h3>
                    <p>In 1965, America was fighting a war called the Vietnam War. Some people liked the war, and some people did not.</p>

                    <p>Three kids in Iowa did not like the war:
- Mary Beth Tinker (13 years old)
- John Tinker (15 years old, Mary Beth's brother)
- Christopher Eckhardt (16 years old)</p>

                    <p>They wanted to show they did not like the war. So they decided to wear black cloth around their arms at school. This is called a black armband.</p>

                    <p>The school bosses found out. They made a new rule: "No black armbands at school."</p>

                    <p>On December 16, 1965, all three kids wore their black armbands anyway. The school sent them home and said they could not come back.</p>

                    <p>The Tinker family took the school to court. They said, "This is not fair! Kids have the right to show what they think!"</p>

                    <h3>The Big Question</h3>
                    <p>Can schools stop kids from wearing armbands to show their ideas?</p>

                        <li>They did not fight or yell</li>
                        <li>They did not stop other kids from learning</li>
                        <li>It was a peaceful protest</li>
                        <li>During a big war that made people upset</li>
