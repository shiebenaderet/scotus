                        <p>This case asks: Should police be able to go into people's homes without asking a judge first? The police say they need to do this to catch bad people and keep everyone safe. But people also have the right to privacy in their own homes. Think about: When should police be able to break this rule to keep people safe?</p>

                    <h3>What Happened?</h3>
                    <p>In 1970, the police in New York City suspected Theodore Payton of murder. They had strong evidence against him, including witness testimony and physical evidence. However, instead of going to a judge to get an arrest warrant, police officers went directly to Payton's home.</p>

                    <p>When Payton was not home, the police entered his house and searched it without permission. They found evidence of the murder in plain view. Later, when Payton was arrested without a warrant, he was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.</p>

                    <h3>The Big Question</h3>
                    <p>Can police enter a suspect's home to make an arrest without a warrant? Does the Fourth Amendment require warrants for home arrests?</p>

                    <h3>What You Need to Know</h3>
                    <p>The Fourth Amendment says:</p>
                    <blockquote class="constitutional-text">
                        "The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause..."
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>This means the government cannot search your home or take your things without a good reason. Usually, they need a warrant from a judge.</p>
                    <p>There's an old saying: "A man's home is his castle." This means people should feel safe from government intrusion in their own homes.</p>

                    <h3>Important Facts</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Six officers went to Payton's apartment at 7:30 AM</li>
                        <li>They had no arrest warrant</li>
                        <li>They broke down the door with a crowbar</li>
                        <li>Payton wasn't home</li>
                        <li>They found a shell casing in plain view</li>
                        <li>New York law allowed warrantless home arrests with probable cause</li>
                        <li>Most other states were moving toward requiring warrants for home arrests</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>What Happened?</h3>
                    <p>A long time ago, police in New York thought a man named Theodore Payton hurt someone. They had good reasons to think this. But they did not do one important thing first.</p>

                    <p>Police are usually supposed to get permission from a judge before going into someone's house. This permission is called a warrant. But the police did not get a warrant.</p>

                    <p>Instead, they went right to Payton's house and went inside without asking. They looked around and found things. Later, Payton was sent to prison based on what they found.</p>

                            <p>Many cities are debating whether police should be allowed to enter homes without announcing themselves. The 2020 Breonna Taylor case in Louisville brought national attention to this issue.</p>

                            <p>Modern homes have doorbell cameras, smart speakers, and other connected devices. Should police need warrants to access data from these devices during investigations?</p>

                            <p>Courts continue to debate when emergencies justify entering homes without warrants. Recent cases involve wellness checks, domestic disputes, and suspected drug activity.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Should the rules for entering homes be different for serious crimes like murder versus less serious offenses?</li>
                        <li>How do you balance giving police the tools they need to catch criminals with protecting everyone's privacy at home?</li>
                        <li>If police have strong evidence someone committed a crime, why should they have to wait for a judge's approval?</li>

                            <p>People still argue about when police can go into someone's house. Some say police need to always knock first. Others say sometimes they need to surprise people to stay safe.</p>
                            <p class="event-note">What do you think: Should police always have to knock and wait?</p>

                            <p>Many homes now have video doorbells and smart speakers. Should police need special permission to look at recordings from these devices?</p>
                            <p class="event-note">What do you think: Is information from your home devices private like your home itself?</p>

                            <p>Sometimes police say they had to enter a home right away because it was an emergency. But who decides what counts as an emergency?</p>
                            <p class="event-note">What do you think: Should police decide, or should they ask a judge first?</p>

                        <li>How do we make sure police can catch bad people while also keeping everyone's homes private?</li>
                        <li>If police are pretty sure someone did something wrong, why do they need to ask a judge first?</li>
