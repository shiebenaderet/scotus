                    <h3>What Happened?</h3>
                    <p>In 1970, the police in New York City suspected Theodore Payton of murder. They had strong evidence against him, including witness testimony and physical evidence. However, instead of going to a judge to get an arrest warrant, police officers went directly to Payton's home.</p>

                    <p>When Payton was not home, the police entered his house and searched it without permission. They found evidence of the murder in plain view. Later, when Payton was arrested without a warrant, he was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.</p>

                    <h3>The Big Question</h3>
                    <p>Can police enter a suspect's home to make an arrest without a warrant? Does the Fourth Amendment require warrants for home arrests?</p>

                    <h3>What You Need to Know</h3>
                    <p>The Fourth Amendment protects people's homes from "unreasonable searches and seizures." Usually, this means that police must have a warrant signed by a judge before entering a private home. But can the requirement for a warrant be waived when police have probable cause to make an arrest?</p>

                    <h3>What Happened?</h3>
                    <p>A long time ago, police in New York thought a man named Theodore Payton hurt someone. They had good reasons to think this. But they did not do one important thing first.</p>

                    <p>Police are usually supposed to get permission from a judge before going into someone's house. This permission is called a warrant. But the police did not get a warrant.</p>

                    <p>Instead, they went right to Payton's house and went inside without asking. They looked around and found things. Later, Payton was sent to prison based on what they found.</p>
