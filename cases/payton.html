                        <p>This case asks: Should police be able to go into people's homes without asking a judge first? The police say they need to do this to catch bad people and keep everyone safe. But people also have the right to privacy in their own homes. Think about: When should police be able to break this rule to keep people safe?</p>

                    <h3>What Happened?</h3>
                    <p>In 1970, the police in New York City suspected Theodore Payton of murder. They had strong evidence against him, including witness testimony and physical evidence. However, instead of going to a judge to get an arrest warrant, police officers went directly to Payton's home.</p>

                    <p>When Payton was not home, the police entered his house and searched it without permission. They found evidence of the murder in plain view. Later, when Payton was arrested without a warrant, he was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.</p>

                    <h3>The Big Question</h3>
                    <p>Can police enter a suspect's home to make an arrest without a warrant? Does the Fourth Amendment require warrants for home arrests?</p>

                    <h3>What You Need to Know</h3>
                    <p>The Fourth Amendment protects people's homes from "unreasonable searches and seizures." Usually, this means that police must have a warrant signed by a judge before entering a private home. But can the requirement for a warrant be waived when police have probable cause to make an arrest?</p>

                    <h3>What Happened?</h3>
                    <p>A long time ago, police in New York thought a man named Theodore Payton hurt someone. They had good reasons to think this. But they did not do one important thing first.</p>

                    <p>Police are usually supposed to get permission from a judge before going into someone's house. This permission is called a warrant. But the police did not get a warrant.</p>

                    <p>Instead, they went right to Payton's house and went inside without asking. They looked around and found things. Later, Payton was sent to prison based on what they found.</p>
