                    <h3>What Happened?</h3>
                    <p>In 2017, a 14-year-old student named B.L. was a cheerleader at Mahanoy Area High School in Pennsylvania. She tried out for the varsity cheerleading team but did not make it. She would have to remain on the junior varsity team for another year.</p>

                    <p>That weekend, still upset about not making varsity, B.L. posted two images on Snapchat with extremely vulgar language and gestures expressing her frustration. She sent these posts to about 250 Snapchat friends, many of whom attended her school and some of whom were on the cheerleading team.</p>

                    <p>A teammate took screenshots of the posts and showed them to her mother, who was a cheerleading coach. The coaches were upset by the vulgar language and gestures, feeling that cheerleaders should be positive role models for the school.</p>

                    <p>The school suspended B.L. from the junior varsity cheerleading team for the entire upcoming year. The school said her posts violated team and school rules about conduct.</p>

                    <p>B.L. and her parents sued the school district, arguing that her First Amendment rights to free speech had been violated. They claimed the school had no authority to punish her for speech that occurred off-campus and outside of school hours.</p>

                    <h3>The Big Question</h3>
                    <p>Can schools punish students for speech posted on social media when they are off-campus and outside of school hours?</p>

                    <h3>What You Need to Know</h3>
                    <p>The First Amendment says "Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech." This protects people's right to express themselves. The key question is whether schools have authority over student speech that happens away from school.</p>

                    <h3>Important Facts</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>B.L. made the posts on a weekend, away from school property</li>
                        <li>She used vulgar language and made obscene gestures</li>
                        <li>The posts were seen by many students and some cheerleaders</li>
                        <li>No significant disruption occurred at school as a result</li>
                        <li>B.L. was suspended from the team for an entire year</li>
                        <li>This was the first major Supreme Court case about social media and student speech</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>B.L. was a high school cheerleader. She loved to cheer for her school team.</p>

                    <p>In 2017, B.L. tried out for the best cheerleading team. She did not make it. She had to stay on the younger kids' team. She was very sad and mad.</p>

                    <p>That weekend, B.L. went to a store with her friend. She was still upset. She took out her phone and posted pictures on Snapchat. Snapchat is an app where you can send pictures to friends.</p>

                    <p>B.L. posted pictures showing her middle finger and using bad words about school and cheerleading.</p>

                    <p>She sent these pictures to about 250 friends. Most of them went to her school. Some were cheerleaders.</p>

                    <p>Someone saved the pictures and showed them to the coaches. The coaches were mad. They said cheerleaders should be good examples.</p>

                    <p>The coaches kicked B.L. off the cheerleading team. She could not cheer for a whole year.</p>

                    <p>B.L. and her parents said, "This is not fair! She posted this away from school on the weekend!"</p>
